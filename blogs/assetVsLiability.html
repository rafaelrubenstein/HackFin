    In the simpilest terms, an asset is anything that has value and makes you money(for example a house you rent out, or a stock).A
    liability is anything that loses you money (it can have value as well, like a house). So the question is, how do i identify
    whats an asset and what is a liability? Follow these rules to classify an asset.
<ul>
    <li>it has value</li>
    <li>youre not always only losing money, you can make financial gains on it</li>
    <li>it puts money in your pocket</li>
</ul>
To identify an liability follow these rules.
<ul>
    <li>it has value</li>
    <li>you can not make any finincial gains on it</li>
    <li>it increaces your debt</li>
    <li>it take money out of your pocket</li>
</ul>

in conclusion, be very smart with your purchases. budget and plan accordingly, and remember
just because it makes you money doesnt mean its a good asset!
